However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowl-\\nedge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance\\nlags behind task-speciﬁc architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their\\ndecisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-\\ntrained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric\\nmemory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We\\nexplore a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation\\n(RAG) — models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric mem-\\nory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric\\nmemory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense\\nvector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We com-\\npare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages\\nacross the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages\\nper token. We ﬁne-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-\\nintensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks,\\noutperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-speciﬁc retrieve-and-extract\\narchitectures.

They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized\\nimplicit knowledge base [51, 52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down-\\nsides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into\\ntheir predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric\\nmemory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [20, 26, 48] can address some of these\\nissues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be\\ninspected and interpreted.

Here, we bring hybrid parametric\\nand non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models.\\nWe endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through\\na general-purpose ﬁne-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\\nWe build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the\\nnon-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural\\nretriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The\\nretriever (Dense Passage Retriever [26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on\\nthe input, and the seq2seq model (BART [32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with\\nthe input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation,\\neither on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token\\nbasis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [51] or BART, RAG\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned.\\nThere has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric\\nmemory which are trained from scratch for speciﬁc tasks, e.g. memory networks [ 64, 55], stack-\\naugmented networks [25] and memory layers [ 30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both\\nparametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive\\nknowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is\\npresent without additional training.\\nOur results highlight the beneﬁts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera-\\ntion for knowledge-intensive tasks—tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform\\nwithout access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results\\non open Natural Questions [29], WebQuestions [3] and CuratedTrec [2] and strongly outperform\\nrecent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [24]. Despite these being\\nextractive tasks, we ﬁnd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches.\\nFor knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [1] and Jeopardy question\\ngeneration, and we ﬁnd that our models generate responses that are more factual, speciﬁc, and\\ndiverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [56] fact veriﬁcation, we achieve results within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that\\nthe non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1\\n2 Methods\\nWe explore RAG models, which use the input sequencexto retrieve text documents zand use them\\nas additional context when generating the target sequence y. As shown in Figure 1, our models\\nleverage two components: (i) a retriever pη(z|x) with parameters ηthat returns (top-K truncated)\\ndistributions over text passages given a query xand (ii) a generator pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1) parametrized\\n1Code to run experiments with RAG has been open-sourced as part of the HuggingFace Transform-\\ners Library [66] and can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/\\nexamples/rag/.

In one approach, RAG-Sequence, the model uses the same document\\nto predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token, can predict each target token based\\non a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the\\npη and pθ components, as well as the training and decoding procedure.\\n2.1 Models\\nRAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate\\nthe complete sequence. Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that\\nis marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y|x) via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the\\ntop K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence\\nprobability for each document, which are then marginalized,\\npRAG-Sequence(y|x) ≈\\n∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)pθ(y|x,z) =\\n∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)\\nN∏\\ni\\npθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)\\nRAG-Token Model In the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each\\ntarget token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several\\ndocuments when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the\\nretriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document,\\nbefore marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne:\\npRAG-Token(y|x) ≈\\nN∏\\ni\\n∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)\\nFinally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class\\nas a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent.\\n2.2 Retriever: DPR\\nThe retrieval component pη(z|x) is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture:\\npη(z|x) ∝exp\\n(\\nd(z)⊤q(x)\\n)\\nd(z) =BERTd(z), q(x) =BERTq(x)\\nwhere d(z) is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERTBASE document encoder [8],\\nand q(x) a query representation produced by a query encoder, also based on BERTBASE. Calculating\\ntop-k(pη(·|x)), the list of kdocuments zwith highest prior probability pη(z|x), is a Maximum Inner\\nProduct Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [23]. We use\\na pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This\\nretriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [24] questions and\\nNatural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory.\\n2.3 Generator: BART\\nThe generator component pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1) could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use\\nBART-large [32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input\\nxwith the retrieved content zwhen generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was\\npre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained\\nstate-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5\\nmodels [32].

Instead, we run beam search for\\neach document z, scoring each hypothesis using pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1). This yields a set of hypotheses\\nY, some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability\\nof an hypothesis y we run an additional forward pass for each document z for which y does not\\nappear in the beam, multiply generator probability with pη(z|x) and then sum the probabilities across\\nbeams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer\\noutput sequences, |Y|can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding,\\nwe can make a further approximation that pθ(y|x,zi) ≈0 where ywas not generated during beam\\nsearch from x,zi. This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Y has\\nbeen generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.”\\n3 Experiments\\nWe experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use\\na single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and\\nKarpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint\\n100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an\\nembedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [23] with a Hierarchical\\nNavigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [37]. During training, we retrieve the top\\nkdocuments for each query. We consider k∈{5,10}for training and set kfor test time using dev\\ndata. We now discuss experimental details for each task.\\n3.1 Open-domain Question Answering\\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed\\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks [20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x,y)\\nand train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to\\nthe popular extractive QA paradigm [5, 7, 31, 26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved\\ndocuments, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book\\nQA” approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead\\nrelying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural\\nQuestions (NQ) [29], TriviaQA (TQA) [24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [2]. As\\nCT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG\\nmodel. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [ 31, 26] and report Exact Match (EM)\\nscores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set.\\n3.2 Abstractive Question Answering\\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive\\ntext generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting,\\nwe use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [ 43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages\\nretrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the\\nretrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat\\n4'),\n",

MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be\\nanswered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as\\n“What is the weather in V olcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages.\\nWe also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here,\\nRAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses.\\n3.3 Jeopardy Question Generation\\nTo evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen-\\neration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist\\nof short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions.\\nJeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity.\\nFor example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the ﬁrst\\ncountry to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise,\\nfactual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a\\nchallenging knowledge-intensive generation task.\\nWe use the splits from SearchQA [ 10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As\\nthis is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [67], we evaluate using the\\nSQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [ 42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for\\nmatching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than\\nstandard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and\\none for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external\\nsources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [ 33]. We follow\\nbest practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two\\ngenerated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four\\noptions—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good.\\n3.4 Fact Veriﬁcation\\nFEVER [ 56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by\\nWikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving\\nevidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify\\nwhether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem\\ncoupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for\\nexploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map FEVER\\nclass labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with\\nclaim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on\\nretrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and\\nmodels that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore\\ntwo variants: the standard 3-way classiﬁcation task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way\\n(supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy.\\n4 Results\\n4.1 Open-domain Question Answering\\nTable 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA\\ntasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines\\nthe generation ﬂexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of\\n\"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results\\nwithout expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s\\nretriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions\\nand TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “cross-\\nencoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a\\nre-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance.\\nThere are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them. Docu-\\nments with clues about the answer but do not contain the answer verbatim can still contribute towards\\na correct answer being generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading\\n5'),\n",

Table 3 shows some generated answers\\nfrom our models. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually\\ncorrect text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than\\nBART generations (see §4.5).\\n4.3 Jeopardy Question Generation\\nTable 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation,\\nwith both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452\\npairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more factual\\nthan RAG in only 7.1% of cases, while RAG was more factual in 42.7% of cases, and both RAG and\\nBART were factual in a further 17% of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG on\\nthe task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also ﬁnd RAG generations to be more\\nspeciﬁc by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model.\\nJeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform\\nbest because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows\\nan example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The\\nSun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is\\ngenerated. Intriguingly, after the ﬁrst token of each book is generated, the document posterior ﬂattens.\\nThis observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on speciﬁc\\ndocuments. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufﬁcient to complete the titles. We\\nﬁnd evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the BART-only baseline with the partial decoding\"The\\nSun. BART completes the generation \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"The Sun\\nAlso Rises\" indicating the title \"The Sun Also Rises\" is stored in BART’s parameters. Similarly,\\nBART will complete the partial decoding \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A\\nwith \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A Farewell to Arms\". This example shows\\nhow parametric and non-parametric memories work together—the non-parametric component helps\\nto guide the generation, drawing out speciﬁc knowledge stored in the parametric memory.\\n4.4 Fact Veriﬁcation\\nTable 2 shows our results on FEVER. For 3-way classiﬁcation, RAG scores are within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art models, which are complex pipeline systems with domain-speciﬁc architectures and\\nsubstantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which RAG does not require.\\n6'),\n",

We calculate the overlap in article titles between the topkdocuments retrieved\\nby RAG and gold evidence annotations. We ﬁnd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article\\nin 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases.\\n4.5 Additional Results\\nGeneration Diversity Section 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and speciﬁc than\\nBART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding\\n[33, 59, 39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to\\ntotal ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence’s generations are\\nmore diverse than RAG-Token’s, and both are signiﬁcantly more diverse than BART without needing\\nany diversity-promoting decoding.\\nRetrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task.\\nTo assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever\\nduring training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks.\\nWe compare RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [53]. Here, we replace\\nRAG’s retriever with a ﬁxed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating\\np(z|x). Table 6 shows the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are\\nheavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval\\nimproves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial.\\nIndex hot-swapping An advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge\\ncan be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to\\nupdate their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [5]\\nWikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer\\nindex from our main results (December 2018). We prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed\\n7'),\n",

A single, pre-trained language model\\nhas been shown to achieve strong performance on various classiﬁcation tasks in the GLUE bench-\\nmarks [60, 61] after ﬁne-tuning [49, 8]. GPT-2 [50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained\\nlanguage model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks.\\nFor further improvement, BART [32] and T5 [51, 52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder\\nmodel that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative\\nand generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uniﬁed\\narchitecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models.\\nLearned Retrieval There is signiﬁcant work on learning to retrieve documents in information\\nretrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [ 44, 26] similar to ours. Some\\nwork optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a speciﬁc, downstream task such as question answering,\\nusing search [46], reinforcement learning [6, 63, 62], or a latent variable approach [31, 20] as in our\\nwork. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to\\nachieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks.\\nMemory-based Architectures Our document index can be seen as a large external memory for\\nneural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [64, 55]. Concurrent work [14] learns\\nto retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our\\nwork. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over\\nfact embeddings [15, 13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather\\ndistributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of\\ninterpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s\\nmemory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive\\ndialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF\\nrather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9].\\nRetrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style\\napproaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited\\nto provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including\\nMachine Translation [ 18, 22] and Semantic Parsing [21]. Our approach does have several differences,\\nincluding less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several\\npieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents\\nrather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and\\ncould represent promising future work.\\n6 Discussion\\nIn this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric\\nmemory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\\nfound that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\\nand speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\\nits effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\\nwithout requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\\ncan be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\\nanother objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\\nmemories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\\nwide variety of NLP tasks.\\n9'),\n",

Since RAG can be\\nemployed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [50] are valid here, although arguably\\nto a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\\nthe news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing\\ncontent [54].

We included some gold sentences in order to\\nassess the accuracy of the annotators. Two annotators did not perform well on these examples and\\ntheir annotations were removed from the results.\\nC Training setup Details\\nWe train all RAG models and BART baselines using Fairseq [45].2 We train with mixed precision\\nﬂoating point arithmetic [40], distributing training across 8, 32GB NVIDIA V100 GPUs, though\\ntraining and inference can be run on one GPU. We ﬁnd that doing Maximum Inner Product Search\\nwith FAISS is sufﬁciently fast on CPU, so we store document index vectors on CPU, requiring∼100\\nGB of CPU memory for all of Wikipedia. After submission, We have ported our code to HuggingFace\\nTransformers [66]3, which achieves equivalent performance to the previous version but is a cleaner\\nand easier to use implementation. This version is also open-sourced. We also compress the document\\nindex using FAISS’s compression tools, reducing the CPU memory requirement to 36GB. Scripts to\\nrun experiments with RAG can be found athttps://github.com/huggingface/transformers/\\nblob/master/examples/rag/README.md and an interactive demo of a RAG model can be found\\nat https://huggingface.co/rag/\\n2https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq\\n3https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\\n17'),\n",

These\\nanswer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\\nannotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\\nalso make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training\\nthe model with each (q,a) pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\\nthere are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\\nsuch as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we ﬁlter out answer candidates if they do not occur\\nin top 1000 documents for the query.\\nCuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\\nsions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].\\nTo overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we ﬁrst retrieve the top 1000 documents for\\neach query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision\\ntarget. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for\\neach regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups The open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop-\\nment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading\\ncompehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [26], which are\\nconsistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public\\nTriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al.[52] used the TriviaQA ofﬁcial Wikipedia test set\\ninstead. Févry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See\\nappendix of [14]). We report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches.\\nWe ﬁnd that our performance is much higher using the ofﬁcial Wiki test set, rather than the more\\nconventional open-domain test set, which we attribute to the ofﬁcial Wiki test set questions being\\nsimpler to answer from Wikipedia.\\nE Further Details on FEVER\\nFor FEVER classiﬁcation, we follow the practice from [ 32], and ﬁrst re-generate the claim, and\\nthen classify using the representation of the ﬁnal hidden state, before ﬁnally marginalizing across\\ndocuments to obtain the class probabilities. The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The\\nﬁrst is to classify the claim as either \"Supported\", \"Refuted\" or \"Not Enough Info\", which is the task\\nwe explore in the main paper. FEVER’s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia\\nas evidence supporting the classiﬁcation prediction. As FEVER uses a different Wikipedia dump to\\nus, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. We hope to address this in future work.\\nF Null Document Probabilities\\nWe experimented with adding \"Null document\" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [20] in order\\nto model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, ifkdocuments\\nwere retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null\\ndocument, before marginalizing over k+ 1predictions. We explored modelling this null document\\nlogit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or\\n(iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not ﬁnd that these improved performance, so in\\nthe interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents\\ncannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of\\ndocuments for questions that are less likely to beneﬁt from retrieval, suggesting that null document\\nmechanisms may not be necessary for RAG.\\nG Parameters\\nOur RAG models contain the trainable parameters for the BERT-base query and document encoder of\\nDPR, with 110M parameters each (although we do not train the document encoder ourselves) and\\n406M trainable parameters from BART-large, 406M parameters, making a total of 626M trainable\\n18'),\n",
